water
=====

we have one math issue,
if we can describe some array (which is in water.php) as rocks we can have
<pre>
                     _
                    | |
                   _| |
                  | | |
 _               _| | |
| |  _   _      | | | |
| |_| |_| |_ _ _| | | |
|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
 3 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 3 5 7
</pre>
The question is how to calculate the water which will be here (in the pool)
But we should count it while walking through one time only
